        <div id="section1"><p>Of the doctrines central to the Stoic worldview, perhaps the most important is the unwavering conviction that the world is organized in a rational and coherent way. 
          <P>
          More specifically, it is controlled and directed by an all-pervading force that the Stoics designated by the term logos. 
          <P>
          The term (from which English “logic” and the suffix “-logy” derive) has a semantic range so broad as to be almost untranslatable. 
          <P>
          At a basic level it designates rational, connected thought— whether envisioned as a characteristic or as the product of that characteristic.
          <P>
          Logos operates both in individuals and in the universe as a whole. 
          <P>

          In individuals it is the faculty of reason. 
          <P>

          On a cosmic level it is the rational principle that governs the organization of the universe.
          <P>

          In this sense it is synonymous with “nature,” “Providence,” or “God.” 
          <P>

          All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. 
          <P>

          Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. 
          <P>

          In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable. 
          <P>

          According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. 
          <P>

          If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. 
          <P>

          In the same way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated by the logos and form part of its plan.
          <P>

          Even actions which appear to be immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and good. 
          <P>

          They, too, are governed by the logos. 
          <P>

          But the logos is not simply an impersonal power that governs and directs the world. 
          <P>

          It is also an actual substance that pervades that world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a form as concrete as oxygen or carbon. 
          <P>

          It is the force that through the green fuse drives the flower and is present even in lifeless materials like stone or metal as the energy that holds the object together.
          <P>

          All objects are thus a compound of lifeless substance and vital force. 
          <P>

          When the object perishes, the soul that animated it is reabsorbed into the logos as a whole. 
          <P>

          This process of destruction and reintegration happens to individual objects at every moment. 
          <P>

          It also happens on a larger scale to the entire universe, which at vast intervals is entirely consumed by fire.
          <P>

          If the world is indeed orderly, if the logos controls all things, then the order it produces should be discernible in all aspects of it. 
          <P>

          That supposition not only led the Stoics to speculate about the nature of the physical world but also motivated them to seek the rationality characteristic of the logos in other areas.
          <P>

          This systematizing impulse reappears in many other fields as well.
          <P>

          The catalogue of Chrysippus’s own works preserved by the late-third-century biographer Diogenes Laertius is very long indeed.
          <P>

          It includes not only philosophical treatises in a narrow sense, but also works such as “On How to Read Poetry” and “Against the Touching Up of Paintings.” 
          <P>

          Later Stoics would try their hands at history and anthropology as well as more conventionally philosophical topics. 
          <P>

          The expansion of Stoic thought was not only intellectual but also geographical. 
          <P>

          The movement had been born in Athens. 
          <P>

          In the century and a half that followed Chrysippus’s death it spread to other centers, in particular to Rome. 
          <P>

          The Romans of the second century B.C. were in the midst of a course of conquest that by the end of the century would leave them the effective masters of the Mediterranean. 
          <P>

          With conquest came culture.
